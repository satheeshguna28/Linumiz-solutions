# Linumiz-solutions
Hello anna,
I had login into the linux server using putty and practiced basic shell scripting commands there.
Additionally, I have installed Ubuntu 20.04 through Virtual_box and getting used to it.
I am learning new linux commands and various communication protocol concepts daily.
Thank you.
