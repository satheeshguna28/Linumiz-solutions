Create a chat client in shell i.e 2 shell script running in 2 terminals and communicating over pipe.

//code for writing end terminal

#!/bin/bash

pipe=/tmp/testpipe

if [[ ! -p $pipe ]]; then
    echo "Reader not available :("
    exit 1
fi


if [[ "$1" ]]; then
    echo "$1" >$pipe
else
    echo "Reader available :)"
    echo "Type a message to send or Type 'end' to quit:"
    read line
    echo "$line" >$pipe
    echo "Message sent"
fi


//code for reading end terminal

#!/bin/bash

pipe=/tmp/testpipe

trap "rm -f $pipe" EXIT

if [[ ! -p $pipe ]]; then
    mkfifo $pipe
fi

while true
do
    if read line <$pipe; then
        if [[ "$line" == 'end' ]]; then
            echo "Thanks for messaging :)"
            break
        fi
        echo "Message received"
        echo "Received message : $line"
    fi
done
