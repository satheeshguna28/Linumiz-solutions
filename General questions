1. Write a brief summary about I2C protocol.

2. Write short text about, pull up resistor, pull down resistor, open drain, active low, active high.

Pull up/down resisters:
  ● These are the resisters that are used in digital circuits, to pull the voltage level in digital inputs, equivalent to the level of VCC(pull up) or to thr ground(pull down).
  ● These resister's value can be calculated depending on which logic family that the digital circuit belongs to. 





3. Short text about Linux booting process and the role of Kernel.

4. Text about first impression on Zephyr RTOS.
